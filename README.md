# DESN 378: Code + Design 2

A living document of my journey through interaction design and creative code.

## About This Repository

This is my workspace for DESN 378 at Eastern Washington University. Throughout the quarter, I'm learning to make the web *behave*—responding to users, animating with purpose, and building systems that adapt.

By the end, this becomes my portfolio.
