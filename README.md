# Welcome to DESN 378: Code + Design 2

Also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**)

This template is your workspace for the quarter. By the end, it becomes your portfolio.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create Your Repository

1. Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"**
2. Name it: `**DESN378-code-design-2**'
3. Set to **Public**

### Step 2: Set Up Your Profiles (All Must Match)

- Fill out `PROFILE.md` with your info
- Update **ALL** your profiles to match:
  - **GitHub** — Name, photo, bio
  - **Figma** — Same name, same photo
  - **CodePen** — Same name, same photo
- Same name. Same photo. Consistent presence.
- See the checklist in `PROFILE.md` to track your progress.

### Step 3: Update This README

- Replace this welcome content with YOUR portfolio README
- Use the template in **Section 4** below as a starting point
- Make it yours — no two should look the same

### Step 4: Add Your Portfolio

- Replace the starter `index.html` with your portfolio content
- The file structure is already set up for you:
  ```
  index.html
  css/styles.css
  scripts/main.js
  assets/images/, fonts/, video/
  ```
- This will be your GitHub Pages site

### Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Source: **Deploy from branch** → **main** → **/ (root)**
3. Your site will be live at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name`

### Step 6: Add Your Live Link

At the top of your new README, add the link to your live portfolio:

```markdown
🔗 **[View my portfolio](https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name)**
```

## About This Repository

This is my workspace for DESN 378 at Eastern Washington University. Throughout the quarter, I'm learning to make the web behave—responding to users, animating with purpose, and building systems that adapt.

By the end, this becomes my portfolio.

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Pages not deploying

1. Check Settings → Pages → Source is set to "main" branch
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for initial deployment
3. Check the Actions tab for build errors
4. Make sure `index.html` is in the root (not in a subfolder)

### Student benefits expired

1. Go to [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/benefits)
2. Re-verify with your @ewu.edu email
3. Benefits usually renew within 24-48 hours

### Copilot not suggesting code

1. Make sure GitHub Student Pack is active
2. In VS Code, check that Copilot extension is installed and signed in
3. Try typing a comment describing what you want, then press Enter
